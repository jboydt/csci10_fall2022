# CSCI 10, Butte College, Fall 2022

Labs and projects for CSCI 10-N2465 (Computer Architecture &amp; Organization), Fall 2022, Butte College.

Many thanks to **GreenXenith**, a student in the Fall 2021 section of this course, for the HLA syntax highlighting extension for VS Code.

NOTE:

- if installing the HLA tools on your own Linux system, you will need _libc6-i386_ package
